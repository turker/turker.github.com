I'm in process of creating a personal site and moving my existing blog to Jekyll and Github pages. Things may not be working perfectly at times as this is still a work in progress but I believe the skeleton is there.

I am planning to populate the site with more content and posts in the coming days. The design will most probably largely stay the same but I will need to make a few changes to fix some issues with the responsiveness of the home page.

I always liked the simplicity of posting to Tumblr and even Wordpress. However, I wanted little bit more control and the ability to be able to just post static content in the form of blog posts and web pages. Github pages fits the bill with its ability to host static content which I can keep anywhere on my local machine and publish by just pushing to a Github repository.
