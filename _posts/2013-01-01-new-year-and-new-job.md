I am starting the new year with a new job. I will be a Program Manager on the Core Ranking and Relevance team at Bing starting from tomorrow.

I spent two great years as a Program Manager on the OData team. Over the two years it was awesome to ship the [open source](http://odatavalidator.codeplex.com) [OData Validator](http://validator.odata.org), the [vocabularies](http://www.odata.org/blog/2011/10/14/vocabularies-in-odata) feature in OData v3 and in [WCF Data Services 5.0](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astoriateam/archive/2012/04/09/wcf-data-services-5-0-rtm-release.aspx), [OData Client Tools for Windows Phone 7 Apps](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=27570) and [Windows Phone 8 Apps](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astoriateam/archive/2012/10/30/odata-client-tools-for-windows-phone-apps-now-available.aspx). It was also great, in general, to help the team ship the v3 of OData protocol which is [currently in OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=odata) and is on the way to becoming an industry standard.

I worked with many great people and learned a lot on the OData team. Now, I am looking forward to the new challenge in a completely different area. It's fun to start from scratch and try and quickly ramp up in a new technical domain. 

I am wishing myself, my family and everyone a nice, healthy and productive year in 2013.
