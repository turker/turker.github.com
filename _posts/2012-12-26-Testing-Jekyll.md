I just imagined an email application (i.e. an add-on to existing clients) with the following characteristics. 

* Scans all the emails to create "email profiles" for every person that has an email conversation with anyone else. The set can be kept small initially to only include people I most communicate with or most likely to communicate with depending on the graph.
* The email profile may include things like: times of the day the person is emailing the most, average time taken to reply, most active interests, email communication style, most influenced by etc.

This could be helpful in many ways like:

* Timing an important message at the right time based on most active reply time of the person based on the profile.
* Tuning the tone, brevity, detail of the email based on the communication style of the person
* Knowing who to possible add to the thread based who that person is most influenced by
* etc. etc.



I think most parts of something like this would be possible today. I just wanted to capture this here in this raw form as I thought about it since it wouldn't fit in 140 chars or less.
